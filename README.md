# Catie Schultz's Project Portfolio

Hello! Welcome to a collection of coding projects and problems to showcase my skills and knowledge. I have separated my work into projects I have completed for courses at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and personal projects I created on my own time.

Through these projects I show proficency in C++ and Python, as well as experience with HTML and CSS.
